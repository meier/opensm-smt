.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This SMT command uses the Java classpath and execution environment to provide attribution information for the various JAR packages that are used with \fBOMS\fR and \fBSMT\fR\. It is common practice to populate a JAR package with a MANIFEST that includes the provenance, or record of when it was built and by whom\. The intent is to give credit to all the freely available software used by this set of tools\.
