.SS "Notes"
this is just a section with notes and I have indented this section by two spaces\. I don\'t know how it will handle line wraps or parts of paragraphs but this will hopefully show that\. I would like to also double indent, so will try that here\. But I will first try to see how a line starting on a new line gets formatted\. I think it just gets appended, but I am not sure\.
.
.P
And what about a new line with a blank line in between? Does that get appended as well, or does it start a new line, and if it starts a new line, does it need to be indented, or does that happen automatically\.
.
.P
This may be the answer to that because I indented tis line by two spaces, and only two spaces, just to see what would happen, and it looks like I will also see how the line gets wrapped\.
